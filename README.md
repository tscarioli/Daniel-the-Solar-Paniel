# Daniel-the-Solar-Paniel
Originally developed as a science fair project, this project focuses on collecting and analyzing real-world solar panel power data.

## Overview
- An Arduino is used to record solar panel measurements over time and log them to a CSV file
- The data is then processed in Python for visualization and easier analysis

## Tools and Methods
- Arduino / C++ for data collection
- Python (matplotlib, CSV processing) for data analysis and plotting

## Files
- solar_panel_3.0.ino — Arduino code for collecting solar panel data
- daniel_plotter&time.py — Python script to plot the data and generate a cleaned CSV with aligned time frames
- *.stl — 3D-printed components for the physical setup
